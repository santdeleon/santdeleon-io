      I&apos;m a self-taught programmer based out of Houston, Texas. My early
      professional years were spent as a music producer and audio engineer
      before falling down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole â€“ where i&apos;ve spent
      the last 8 years.
      <br />
      <br />
      When i&apos;m not deep in the crypto trenches i&apos;m usually studying
      piano or riding my motorcycle around the city. Anyway, that&apos;s a tiny
      bit of the good stuff. Give me a shout if you&apos;d like to connect!
